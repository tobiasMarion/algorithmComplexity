# 📘 Algorithm Complexity – INF05515

This repository is dedicated to the course **Algorithm Complexity (INF05515 - UFRGS, 2025/1)**.  
It is structured as a **digital notebook** containing summaries, notes, solved exercise lists and especially **solved Codeforces problems**.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Consolidate the course content through practice.  
- Solve classical algorithm design and analysis problems.  
- Relate each theoretical topic to practical exercises.  
- Build a resource for revision, consultation, and sharing knowledge.

## 🚀 Practice on Codeforces
Most of the repository is dedicated to **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)** problems.  
Each solution includes:
- Problem statement (link to the platform)  
- Implementation in code  
- Complexity analysis  
- Commentary on the solution approach
